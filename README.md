#### Tiny but powerful

Many thanks to [**@mpalau**](http:///twitter.com/mpalau) & [**@necsoft**](http:///twitter.com/necsoft)

The truth is that **Penny** isn't a framework (yet), but it's the best way to start a frontend project

## Requirements
- NodeJS (Recommended 4.5.0)
- npm (Recommended 3.10.6)

## Install

```
npm start
```

## Usage

```
gulp
```
- This will run everything on development mode (source maps, expanded, etc)

```
gulp build
```
- When the project is done
